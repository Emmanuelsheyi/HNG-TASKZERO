          <h3>Areas of low confidence</h3>
          <p>When i make amistake, I tend to beat myself up a bit. But I'm learning to take feedback as a way to improve rather than a personal failure.</p>
          <ul> 
          <li>Handling complex or unfamiliar tasks: When i see <br> a big codebase I sometimes doubt my ability to <br>understand or fix things quickly.</li>
          <li>speaking up in group discussions: sometimes <br> i hesitate to share my ideas because i worry they <br> might sound wrong or too simple.</li>
          <li>Asking for help when I need it: I often feel like <br> I should be able to figure things out on my own, <br> but I'm learning that it's okay to ask for assistance.</li>
          </ul>
