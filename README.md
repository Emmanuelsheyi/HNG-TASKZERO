# Profile Card — Stage 1 (Emmanuel)

This project is a small, accessible, responsive Profile Card. extended with more deliverables:
Contact and About pages, client-side form validation, and accessibility improvements. It's implemented with plain
HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript — no build step required.

## What I implemented

# Profile Card — simple README

This is a small, accessible profile card built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It includes a page with an editable
avatar and two extra pages: Contact and About.

Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the profile card.
2. Open `contact.html` to try the contact form (client-side validation).
3. Open `about.html` to read the About page.

Files I added and changed
- `index.html` — main profile card and avatar controls.
- `style.css` — styles and responsive rules.
- `script.js` — avatar handling and time updater.
- `contact.html` + `contact.js` — contact form and validation.
- `about.html` — About page content.



Notes
- No build step or dependencies — just open the HTML files in a browser.
- Accessibility: inputs are labelled; error messages use `role="alert"` and are announced to screen readers.
